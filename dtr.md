Project:

Group Member Names: Aiden Mendez, Max Ribbans

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):  

Comfort working in a technical group setting, having workflow be beneficial instead of taking more time. We will know that we are successful if we get a 4, and we are happy!

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

Chunking and planning, and working well.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

Our strengths tie into testing, and looking ahead.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

Evenings mostly, but also as communication develops. 7-9, mountain time, as a general aim. Mornings tbd, maybe working, if lots of chunked individual work have a short 10 minute retro...

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

Frequent communication, centered around evening work. School hours 30 minute responses. Communicate about communication also.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Comfort with class. Test Driven Development. Git flow. New enumerables.


Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

TBD. Communication on present work.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Push and pull each change. Communicating any changes made before doing it.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:

25 minutes on, 5 off.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Lots!

Additional Remote Considerations:

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or __Trello__ are popular tools):

Day 1 Agenda: Scheduling, prep work, actually coding at 7:30 - 8:30 mst.
