__Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):__  

  Comfort working in a technical group setting, having workflow be beneficial instead of taking more time. We will know that we are successful if we get a 4, and we are happy!

__Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):__

Chunking and planning, and working well.

__How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:__

Our strengths tie into testing, and looking ahead.

__Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):__

Evenings mostly, but also as communication develops. 7-9, mountain time, as a general aim. Mornings tbd, maybe working, if lots of chunked individual work have a short 10 minute retro...

__Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):__

Frequent communication, centered around evening work. School hours 30 minute responses. Communicate about communication also.

__Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):__

Comfort with class. Test Driven Development. Git flow. New enumerables.

__Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):__

TBD. Communication on present work.

__Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):__

Push and pull each change. Communicating any changes made before doing it.

__Pomodoro Break Schedule:__
